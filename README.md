# playing-with-data

## What is it?
It's a reposiotry that contains a list of projects I did in 2020. It contains notebooks that I made to explore datasets, engineer features and build machine learning models to make predictions.

## List of Projects:
- adult-UCI-dataset - The adult UCI dataset about the income of all people 18 and above. 
- sales-analysis-data-2019 - A custom built dataset where I explore the sale of a large store.
- winconsin-breast-cancer-research - The Winconsin breast cancer research data was explored and visualized.
